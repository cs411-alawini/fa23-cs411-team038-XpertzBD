# LACrimeGuard

LACrimeGuard' is a digital platform that we have designed to utilize the vast amount of data contained in the Los Angeles Crime Database to give users a more accurate picture of crime dynamics in Los Angeles. At its core, the app provides clear geo-visualizations that translate complex crime data into easily recognizable color-coded densities. In this way, residents can quickly determine the state of safety in different neighborhoods and make informed decisions about their actions and even their living environment.

The real-time alert system is one of the standout features of LACrimeGuard. Whenever the public reports a new crime, the system sends out a timely notification, ensuring that the community is aware of the situation much quicker than traditional police alerts. This not only enhances public safety but also builds a sense of alertness in the community. Additionally, the platform provides users with the flexibility to dive into the details of specific crimes, filtering by parameters such as location, time of day, or age group of the offender. With "LACrimeGuard," the community is not only kept informed, but also actively engaged, creating a safer environment for everyone in Los Angeles.

## Dataset
We will use the dataset stored in the "Crime in Los Angeles Data from 2020 to Present" database which from TA-proposed datasets. 
(link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/susant4learning/crime-in-los-angeles-data-from-2020-to-present).

## Basic Functions and Creative Component
Users will able to control the database to add/delete records and view the crime distribution. The government can also take actions to prevent crime or manage its consequences. For some simple features, The website can be used to create, insert, update and delete crime case in the database.
We would like to create a map to visualize the crime distribution, and use different color to show the danger degree of the districts. In addition, if possible, we want to try to improve the system by creating the function that users can click the specific street on the map and then directly get the input window which already has the location information. We think it is a good idea to avoid repetitive crime case creation because the user can directly see the crimes happened on the street rather than waiting for the checking result after inputting all information. 

## Usefulness. 

1). Crime Prevention and Management
 
2). Resource Allocation and Community Awareness
 
3). Data-Driven Decision Making and Efficient Reporting

4). Uniqueness: In contrast to existing crime mapping and reporting apps like 'Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,' which primarily rely on real-time user-reported incidents and focus on delivering safety alerts and information about ongoing events nearby, our system stands out by utilizing comprehensive historical crime data sourced from official records in LA. This allows us to offer a more extensive perspective on crime incidents over time. Our application is not restricted to real-time alerts; it encompasses a broader range of crime data. Moreover, it offers users the ability to engage with historical crime data, report new incidents, update existing records, and visualize crime distribution on a map. Our web application is geared towards data analysis and proactive crime prevention through insights derived from historical data. It serves both individual users and government entities, whereas Citizen primarily caters to individuals. Another significant distinction is that Citizen is a paid application, while our web application is completely free to use!"
